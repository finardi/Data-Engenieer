# Data Pipelines with Airflow 

## Introduction
> This project consists of a pipeline solution using Apache Airflow. To run the pipeline we create custom operators that read the Sparkify logs, processes and creates the following tables:

## Dimension Tables
*`users`* table features: user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level


*`songs`* table features: song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration


*`artists`* table features: artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude


*`time`* table features: start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Fact Table
*`songplays`* table features: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, session_id, location, user_agent, song_id, artist_id.

## Pipeline description
- `airflow`: folder that stores the airflow DAGs and plug-ins
- `airflow/dags/udac_example_dag.py`: the main DAG that contains all the steps in the pipeline.
- `airflow/plugins/operators/`: folder containing the operators that are used within the DAG.

The pipeline flow is shown in the following figure:

## Datasets description
There are two datasets storaged on Amazon S3:

### **Song Dataset**

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](url:http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### **Log Dataset**
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
